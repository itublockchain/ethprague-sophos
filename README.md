# ♟️ Sophos — Decentralized Real-Time Chess Prediction Market

**Sophos** is a trustless, decentralized betting platform where users predict the next move in live chess matches. Powered by **Yellow Network’s state channels** and **Vlayer’s ZKP-based Web Proofs**, Sophos delivers a fast, gasless, and verifiable experience — turning chess into a game of prediction, skill, and crypto-powered rewards.

## 🚨 Problem Statement

Traditional betting platforms suffer from:
- Centralization and lack of transparency
- High gas fees and constant wallet confirmations
- Delays and disruptions in real-time markets
- Vulnerability to bots and manipulation

🎯 **Sophos aims to fix this** with a real-time, trustless, and bot-resistant system — where logic and timing matter more than luck.

## ♟️ How Sophos Works

### ✅ 1. Live Chess Integration
Sophos streams real-time chess data from the **[Lichess API](https://lichess.org/api)** — no delays, no distortion. Each move reflects the actual game as it happens.

### 🔐 2. Seamless, Gasless Betting
Thanks to **Yellow Network’s** state channel tech:
- Users sign **only once** per session.
- All future bets are processed **offchain**, with **no gas fees** and **no repeated wallet prompts**.
- Enables high-frequency, real-time prediction betting.

### 🔎 3. Trustless Verification with ZKPs
Using **Vlayer’s Web Proofs**, each move is cryptographically verified with **zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs)** and submitted to the blockchain. This ensures:
- Tamper-proof, on-chain verifiability
- Full transparency
- No need to trust any centralized party

### 🎯 4. Prediction + Reward Mechanism
- Players predict the **next move** before it's played.
- Accurate predictions increase your stake in the **dynamic reward pool**.
- Final payouts are based on **accuracy and consistency** throughout the game.
